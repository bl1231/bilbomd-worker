# OpenMPI instructions

Before building docker image, you need to manually copy a OpenMPI source tar.gz file here.

- Head over to the [OpenMPI website](https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v5.0/)
- Download some src tar.gz file (e.g `openmpi-5.0.3.tar.gz`)
- Copy the `openmpi-5.0.3.tar.gz` file into this directory.
